# Graphics

## Where are they?

I am using graphics for this project that are under a non-OS-compatible license. As a result, I cannot distribute the graphics freely, in their original form or in an easily-usable format. 
You can obtain them here: https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/micro-adventure-tilepack-1481/

If you want to use them yourself, you'll have to buy a license. If you do this, feel free to contact me at admin@cpprograms.net with proof of license, and I will provide you with the gbtd files used in the application. 

## How do I edit them?

The tiles themselves are editable using a program called gbtd. (GameBoy Tile Designer) The code expects 16x16 pixel tiles. 

The maps using those tiles are editable using a program called gbmb. (GameBoy Map Builder) 

Both of these programs are available here: http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/intro.html

## Can I build this without them? 

At current, no. If I get some time I may create some really basic (read: crummy) sprites/tiles that mimic the ones in Tystatic's pack, and alter the makefile to use whichever one it finds. If some kind soul submits a pull request to do this before I do, more power to that soul!
